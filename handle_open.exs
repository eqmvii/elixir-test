# File opening example -
# File.open returns a tuple with :ok as the first argument if the file was opened succesfully
# Look for two signatures can cause the function to run differently depending on the arguments it was passed
# the :file.format_error calls an underlying erlang file module
# the File.open calls an Elixir module
# String interpolation: contents of #{} are executed and then substituted back in
